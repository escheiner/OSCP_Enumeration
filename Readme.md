This script was created to make OSCP enumeration a little bit easier

To run 

`sudo ./enum-script.sh $IP` 

Please note that this script is not complete, as it only covers some ports and there are many more that can be useful to enumerate. Also, the script should be run with root privilege and some of the commands may need to be installed before running.
